		<h2> MAKING REFERENCE TO SOMEONE</h2>
		<p>When referring directly to one person it is sometimes easy to default to gendered terms - but be aware some people have preferences on the pronouns you use to refer to them. Keep it gender neutral and this helps to avoid making anyone uncomfortable. </p>

		<h2> SOCIAL MEDIA & ONLINE </h2>
